## Comments

- Renamed some of the required object properties, but they should all be present
- Direct DOM manipulation was used to output all information (except for `id`)
- Re: some things I might get clocked for:
- `Width` and `height` were tricky since the sizes of my images greatly differ, so opted instead to textually display the original image size in a modal
  - (I initially had the original image dimensions displayed with the image credits but felt they weren't being used as image attributes like the assignment asked for)
  - To compensate, the `if/else statement` in the `forEach()` method (line 153 onwards) uses the `height` property of each object to determine how it appears in the modal *(most evident with the Häxan poster)*
  - Chose 700px for modal because it accommodates the ridiculous proportions of the Girl Shy poster & it shouldn't overflow fullscreen windows on an average screen resolution(?)
- But as a result of the above, images are not responsive while opened in the modal (gallery remains responsive and accessible though)
  - However, there is a second scrollbar for the modal should an image overflow (I know it's bad practice)
- In conclusion, everyone who said my images were nothing but trouble for this assignment were right
