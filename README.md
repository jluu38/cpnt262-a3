## Comments

- Added a **Break Me** button on the nav bar that leads to `/asdf` in case you didn't feel like manually slapping some gibberish into the url.
- Opted not to use `req` and `res` to avoid confusion for my own sake.
- `HOST` as an environmental variable popped up in most of the `dotenv` tutorials/documentation/example code I found, but I'm not sure how necessary it is?
  - Included it just in case there was a standard or the like.
